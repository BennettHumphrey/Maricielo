            Not much is known about the legendary Maricielo. <br>
            Some say she lives in a cave near Huaraz, spending every waking moment painting <br>
            Some say she is a monk living on the top of the Misty Volcano in Arequipa <br>
            Some say she lives deep in the Amazon jungle drawing with her monkey servants <br>
            And some say she is a cute girl living in the Sacred Valley who just spends her extra time drawing. <br>
            This is very unlikely however, as the mastery of the pen she exhibits is far beyond what 
            anyone who doesn't dedicate their lives to drawing can ever hope to achieve. <br>
            Noone has ever laid eyes on The Legendary Maricielo, though stories have been told.
            She is depicted here, based off of what stories exist, and we believe this to be an accurate drawing.
            This website is here to display the works that we know to be from The Legendary Maricielo.
            These will probably be the most beautiful drawings you have, or will ever, see in your lifetime. <br>
            Be prepared. Make sure to be sitting down, as many faint at the pure beauty of the masterful depictions. <br>
            Browse to be amazed.
