        The first of the Peppas

        <p>
            This painting is the first in an ongoing series of 
            Peppa Pigs. It seems that The Legendary Maricielo perhaps worships the Peppas? 
            We are not exactly sure of the obsession with the Peppas, but it is obviously a very important figure.
            Perhaps it was a childhood favorite?

            The second in an ongoing series of Peppa Pigs, this one is mirrored from the other one,
            and is seen holding a green guitar. We are not sure the significance of the guitar.
            Also, this one is seen wearing a darker shirt than the first, and this one features a tail while the first one does not.
