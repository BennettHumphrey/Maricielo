             Noone knows the origin of this rainbow worm. The work is titled "Rusano", but people are unsure if
             it is a figure from an obscure show, or purely a figment of the imagination of The Legendary Maricielo
             Note the similiar eyes to the Peppa series, and the masterful red outline, really bringing the whole piece together

            This drawing is believed to be a semi-accurate depiction of the town of Urubamba, 
            in the Sacred Valley of Peru. It is this drawing that gives credit to the theory that 
            The Legendary Maricielo resides in Urubamba. Note the interesting scale, where the pink
            house is the same size as the cow to the right. Also note the missing walls on the pink
            house. We believe this to be a metaphore for something, but we aren't sure what. 
            Experts have stared at this picture for weeks, and are not able to decide on an answer.
